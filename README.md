My Amazon Product Review Analysis 

## PROJECT TOPIC : Amazon Product Review Analysis 


## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The purpose of this Data Analysis Project is to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement of RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. I have achieved this by analysing product and customer review data  


## DATA SOURCE

The Primary source of Data I used for the analysis is Amazon Case Study file and this was shared on my LMS by DSA Incubator hub


## TOOLS USED

- Ms Excel For Data Cleaning
- Ms Excel Pivot Table For Analysis
- Ms Excel Dashboard for visualisation

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0,
4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200,
₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined

I started by cleaning my data where necessary.I used the delimeter to split the category column into 5 columns.I went ahead to calculate and add the necessary columns for my analysis

## RECOMMENDATION 


- The computer and Accessories category should be given a lot of promotions using campaigns,advertisements, digital marketing, etc

This is because this category has the highest discounts and ratings which means the quality is still top notch even with the high discount and the discount helps in driving sales.


- The quality control unit should double check on the poorly rated products from categories like Car and Motorbike, Home and Kitchen.

  This is because even with the discounts their ratings are still low.

  
- Avoid hurting brand Value by removing excessive discounting and test optimal discount range that still retains good average ratings

  This is because as discounts increases beyond a certain point, the average rating across discount buckets shows a drop in ratings


- Check why some categories  outperform others and invest in sourcing similar high demand products in those categories.

- Use incentives and followup emails to encourage reviews because there gaps between categories as shown in the Number of Reviews per category chart

- Even out promotional efforts and consider targeted discounts to underperformed categories to boost visibility  because of the imbalance shown in the Number of products with 50% discount and categories with highest discounts
