##PROJECT TOPIC : Amazon Product Review Analysis 


##PROJECT OVERVIEW

The purpose of this Data Analysis Project is to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement of RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. I have achieved this by analysing product and customer review data  


##DATA SOURCE

The Primary source of Data I used for the analysis is Amazon Case Study file and this was shared on my LMS by DSA Incubator hub


##TOOLS USED

- Ms Excel For Data Cleaning
- Ms Excel Pivot Table For Analysis
- Ms Excel Dashboard for visualisation

##EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0,
4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200,
₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined
